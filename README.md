Our team was tasked with creating a simple and functional web page for FOMO Fest registration. The primary goal was to collect valid user data using a form with the following fields:
**Name **(letters and spaces only)
**Email** (valid format)
**Phone Number** (formatted: (123) 456-7890)
**Event Date** (MM/DD/YYYY)
**Number of Tickets** (1-10)

The FOMO Fest Registration webpage was created using a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The webpage was designed to be responsive, accessible, and user-friendly.

**Approach**
**HTML Structure:** We used HTML to create the basic structure of the registration form, including labels, input fields, and a submit button.
**CSS Styling:** We applied CSS to enhance the form's appearance, making it visually appealing and user-friendly.
**JavaScript Validation & Sanitization:** We implemented JavaScript functions to validate and sanitize user input. This involved:
Using regular expressions to ensure the correct format for name, email, phone number, and date fields.
Restricting the number of tickets to the allowed range.
Displaying error messages to the user if any validation fails.
Preventing form submission until all inputs were valid.


**Challenges**
****Several challenges were encountered during the development of the FOMO Event Registration webpage. These challenges included:

****Ensuring accessibility for all users: While styling, we initially did not consider users with color blindness and ended up using fancy colors. After discussions about the color pallets we decided on using high-contrast colors to ensure inclusivity for all users.

****Implementing form validation: Crafting the correct regular expressions for validating different input formats, especially for phone numbers and dates, required careful consideration and testing.


**Solutions Implemented**
Regular Expression Testing: We utilized online tools and resources to test our regular expressions for accuracy and edge cases thoroughly.
Cross-Browser Testing: We tested our web page on Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge browsers to identify and fix any inconsistencies in validation behaviour.

We successfully created a fully functional event registration web page that adheres to best practices for data validation and user experience. Combining HTML, CSS, and JavaScript proved a powerful toolset for achieving our objectives.
